# vscode-docs-authoring

This repo contains the Learn Authoring Pack VS Code extension, which is an extension pack containing multiple Markdown and YAML helper extensions. The main goal is to provide authoring assistance for contributing to learn.microsoft.com. This repo is our feedback mechanism allowing the community to report issues. We are not accepting outside contributions, but would like to continue improving the existing extensions supported in the Learn Authoring Pack.
